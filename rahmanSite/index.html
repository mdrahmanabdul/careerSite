          </i>
          Basically in the first year first semester there are no core
          subjects in Computer Science to concentrate on but there are
          very easy subjects in which you can score maximum marks.
          These grades will help you later when there are tough subject
          to score in later semesters.In this first year you have to
          concentrate on learning a coding language which has simple
          syntax. C would be great because of its simple syntax. You
          have to learn all the basics in the first year first semester
          itself because it will become easy for you to understand what
          the lecturer is teaching in the second semester. Never skip
          the classes of C Programming language because once you miss
          a topic, as all the topics are interconnected you will not
          understand the topics after that. It is good to be regular to both
          classes and labs. This will help you to get good grades in labs
          as well as semester exams. And you will be in good books of lecturer.

          In the second year we can concentrate on the development part.
          Here we will be learning how to develop website both static and
          dynamic.To do the development part we should learn HTML, CSS,
          Angular and JavaScript. By mastering this we can develop awesome
          websites and you can also apply for internships. Internships are
          not necessary but they give you nice experience about the office
          culture and you will end up learning a lot of things by doing
          internships. Apart from web development you can also concentrate
          on mastering the data structures and algorithms. DSA is very much
          useful for cracking the interviews which you will be attending the
          third year.

        </i>
        In the third year we will be focusing on optimizing the code.
        All the data structures and algorithms we have learnt is not
        enough.We have to learn more than that. We have to solve 20
        to 30 problems on each data structure to master the specific
         data structure.Algorithms play important part in getting the
        placements. Any person can write o(n2) code but the one who
        writes code in less that complexity will be considered as a
        good programmer. You will get to write optimized code only
        when you participate in online coding platforms like
        codechef, hackerank and codeforces etc. Some companies even
        give preference to the student who are good atcompetitive coding.

          </i>
        Well in the fourth year there is nothing much to do. Just focus
        preparing for interviews and if are aiming for product based
        companies then you have to learn the basics of System Design as
        they ask it. Otherwise of are willing to join Service based
        companies then learning a programming language of your choice,
        operating systems, Database management systems is enough to crack
        the interview because they don't ask more than that generally in
        the interview. And also focus on increasing the CGPA if are planning
        to study abroad because for masters CGPA matters alot.
